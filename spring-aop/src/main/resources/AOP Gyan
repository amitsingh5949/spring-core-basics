Joinpoint :
All the eligible places where an advice can be applied
In spring , all public methods defined in spring - managed beans are eligible joinpoint, so a constructor cannot be a joinpoint

Pointcut:
The actual defines subset of joinpoint where advice is applied. So all pointcuts are joinpoints,
We define this subset using poincut language and the defination is called pointcut

Aspect:
Combines pointcut and advice

Advice:
The functionality which we want to apply ata pointcut
Before
After
AfterReturning
AfterThrowing
Around

When a Aspect is used, spring create a proxy in front of all its aspect marked beans and any call to these methods will go through these proxies.
